## Iterations
### Iteration 1 (IT1)
In the initial phase of our design, we focused on selecting lightweight yet sturdy components to ensure our robot met the desired balance of strength and weight. Our first iteration featured a 3D-printed chassis and a steering mechanism made from LEGO parts. However, this design had limitations as the integration of LEGO parts with the 3D-printed chassis was unreliable, and the overall structure was too bulky and heavy. 
### Iteration 2 (IT2)
For the second iteration, we shifted to a fully 3D-printed design, including the steering mechanism. This resolved many of the issues from the previous version. The meshing of the 3D-printed gears and steering components was precise, but we encountered challenges in assembling the components. However, challenges arose when joining the components; some parts didn't align perfectly, and reprinting components was time-consuming.
### Final Iteration (FI)
In the third iteration, we opted for a fully LEGO-based chassis, since we had already achieved a perfect gear mesh with our custom 3D-printed gears and racks, we integrated them into this new design. For the rear wheel motor, we relied on LEGO gears, while the steering mechanism used a custom 3D-printed gear that matched perfectly with the 3D-printed rack, providing the best of both worlds.
## Custom 3D Printed Parts

### Rack & Gear
We designed a custom 7.2 cm rack with a similar groove pattern and design as the standard 6.4 cm LEGO rack. The original 6.4 cm LEGO rack had some problems wherein its shorter length made it difficult to mesh smoothly with the 20-tooth double bevel black LEGO gear, which restricted the wheels from achieving specific steering angles. 

However, even with our 7.2 cm rack, we encountered a minor issue: the grooves of the black LEGO gear and our custom rack werenâ€™t perfectly meshing. While it functioned temporarily, the meshing wasn't ideal, and the error compounded by 0.01 with each turn. To overcome this, we also created a custom 12 tooth gear whose grooves are perfectly meshing with custom rack thus eliminating meshing errors and significantly improved the accuracy of the steering, allowing the wheels to turn at precise angles.
