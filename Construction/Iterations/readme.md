## Iterations
### Iteration 1 (IT1)
In the initial phase of our design, we focused on selecting lightweight yet sturdy components to ensure our robot met the desired balance of strength and weight. Our first iteration featured a 3D-printed chassis and a steering mechanism made from LEGO parts. However, this design had limitations as the integration of LEGO parts with the 3D-printed chassis was unreliable, and the overall structure was too bulky and heavy. 
### Iteration 2 (IT2)
For the second iteration, we shifted to a fully 3D-printed design, including the steering mechanism. This resolved many of the issues from the previous version. The meshing of the 3D-printed gears and steering components was precise, but we encountered challenges in assembling the components. However, challenges arose when joining the components; some parts didn't align perfectly, and reprinting components was time-consuming.
